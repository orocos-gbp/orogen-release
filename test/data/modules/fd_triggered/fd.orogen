# It demonstrates IO-driven tasks
name 'fd'

# This task context will be IO-driven. It requires the FD_DRIVEN_TEST_FILE
# environment variable to contain the file descriptor it should listen to, and
# expects the character sequence 'ABCDE' to be written on it. It will exit(0) if
# the right sequence is sent, and exit(1) otherwise.

    # activity is defined as default for Consumer
