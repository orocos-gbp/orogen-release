# This module is used in TC_GenerationDeployment#test_cross_dependencies test in
# test_deployment.rb.
#
# It demonstrates the cross-project abilities of orogen. This project will use
# the Producer component from cross_producer and subclass its own Consumer
# component, using cross_consumer::Consumer as a base class. Then, it deploys
# both components.
