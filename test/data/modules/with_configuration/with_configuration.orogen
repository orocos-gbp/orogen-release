# This module is used in TC_GenerationTasks#test_needs_configuration in
# test_tasks.rb.
#
# It checks that #needs_configuration works, and does so by checking that the
# task's base class does not require an initial_state parameter as usual.
# Moreover, it checks that #start call configure() before start(), by starting
# the deployment (if that was not the case, start() would fail and the
# deployment would return an error).
