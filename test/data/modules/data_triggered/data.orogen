name 'data'

# This consumer component will be driven by one of its input ports only. It
# writes a file in which the data it received is written, using 'U' if it has
# been triggered by an unknown port (i.e. not triggered by its 'input' port).

# This producer component writes alternatively on both its ports, and exits
# using exit(0) after 10 cycles. It is used in the following static deployment
# to test the port-driven behaviour.
