        # Representation of a RTT operation. Instances of this object are
        # usually created through TaskContext#operation. The generated code will
        # expect the class implementation (user-visible part) to define one
        # method, to serve the call, with almost the same name that the method
        # itself.
        #
        # For instance, the following definition
        #   operation('MyMethod')
        #
        # will require the user-visible part to define
        #   [return value] myMethod([arguments]);
        #
        # (note that the first character of the method name has been set to
        # lowercase to generate the C++ method name)
        #
        # The argument list of the C++ method (the first one) can be defined
        # using Callable#argument. Its return type by using #returns. The
        # default method signature is no return type (i.e. void) and no
        # arguments.
        #
        # The name of the C++ method can be changed #method_name.
        #
        # For instance,
        #   operation('MyMethod').
        #     argument('x', 'double', 'the target X value').
        #     argument('y', 'double', 'the target Y value').
        #     method_name('move').
        #     returns('double')
        #
        # will require the user-visible part to define
        #   double move(double x, double y);
