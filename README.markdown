# oroGen: easy component building for Orocos/RTT

* http://www.rock-robotics.org/stable/documentation/orogen

## What is oroGen ?

oroGen is a specification language and code generator for the Orocos Realtime
Toolkit (RTT). The Orocos/Real Time Toolkit is a C++ library allowing to build
component-based systems (http://www.orocos.org/rtt). The orogen tool allows to
create new components easily.

In oroGen, one write a specification that describes the components you want to
develop. Then, orogen generates the corresponding C++ code and CMake build
system so that you -- the component developer -- has only to care about
implementing the actual functionality.

The remaining of this readme is about oroGen installation. See the user's guide
for more in-depth usage information:
